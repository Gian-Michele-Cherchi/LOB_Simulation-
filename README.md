In market micro-structure, the study of how the price of nancial assets.
An asset is resource owned by a company or multinational. It can produce pos-
itive economical value and can be converted to cash (e.g. Apple, Google, etc,..).
Asset's price is aected by planned execution of a certain volume of orders Q,
called meta-orders. Investors can be private ones(investments banks, etc..) or
public(treasury ministries, public banks, etc...).
In fact, there are very well established empirical results that proved the ex-
istence of Universal laws regulating the mechanics of an order book, a list of
orders that records the interest of Buyers and Sellers of a particular asset or
nancial instrument. A matching tool is used to determine which orders can be
fullled and at which price.
This aspect has an important implication that, perhaps, goes against a common
misconception: nancial markets are not as susceptible by global news media
as one may think.
Indeed, most of price movements are exclusively an endogenous eect which de-
rives from the market micro-structure rather than events in the world's political
or economic environment, for instance
As in many problems in theoretical physics, Universality allows one to abstract
from microscopic details, and focus on global parameters that describe the sys-
tem; this means constructing a "coarse-grained" model that should be able to
reproduce the above mentioned law. Therefore, in the price dynamics there
should be some large scale phenomena emerging from the order book's micro-
scopic dynamics.
Furthermore, Universal Laws regarding the price imply that its behavior is in-
dependent on the period in which the exchange happened, the geographical
position or even the kind of contract traded (Bitcoin, options, futures, ...).
The total orders visible, daily, are much less than total Market Capitalization,
and the quantity which is visible in the order book is again many orders of
magnitude smaller.
Market Capitalization is the total market value of an asset (maybe owned by a
third company) and it is obtained multiplying the current price of one share or
order, times the total number of shares.It can be expressed in dierent curren-
cies.

Subsequently, the latent order book has been introduced, which contains the
intentions of the traders in the market that are not yet visible in the revealed
book, playing an important role in the formation of the price.
Mathematical models have been built to explain this phenomena, together with
more intense empirical research in order to understand the extent of validity of
the square-root law.
More recently, there is evidence of a square-root/linear cross-over behavior of
price returns and this is well described in the models of latent order books , but
it would be interesting to see this in our simulation, even if unfortunately, it
does not seem the case.
